#   - dep_time: Actual departure time
#   - sched_dep_time: Scheduled departure time
#   - delay: Delay in minutes
#   - dep_delay: Departure delay in minutes
#   - arr_time: Actual arrival time
#   - sched_arr_time: Scheduled arrival time
#   - arr_delay: Arrival delay in minutes
#   - carrier: Airline carrier code
#   - flight: Flight number
#   - tailnum: Tail number of the aircraft
#   - origin: Origin airport code
#   - dest: Destination airport code
#   - air_time: Duration of the flight in minutes
#   - distance: Distance of the flight
#   - hour: Hour of the departure time
#   - minute: Minute of the departure time
#   - time_hour: Timestamp of the departure time
#   - temp: Temperature at the time of departure
#   - dewp: Dew point at the time of departure
#   - humid: Humidity at the time of departure
#   - wind_dir: Wind direction at the time of departure
#   - wind_speed: Wind speed at the time of departure
#   - wind_gust: Wind gust at the time of departure
